Hey there! My name is *Dhanraj Padmashali*.  
I’m a seasoned Software Engineer with expertise in android application development, database management, prototyping user interface design and writing APIs.

I'm passionate about creating well designed and functional applications. I love a good brainstorm where I can offer keen insight and recommendations. I've the ability to produce an in depth and meaningful action plan specific and customised to the companies needs, while being technologically unbiased to help achieve the end result. I like to be involved and get to contribute to something which empowers people with software.

I'm currently primarily employed at Humesis Inc. Over the past two years, I’ve developed various modules to jump start the next android application. I’ve written applications that consume REST API’s and communicate over the cloud across various platforms. I’m also actively engaged in designing the database structure and generating APIs for end users. I’ve also worked on refining the user experience for our web products. 

When I'm not working, you can find me reading science fiction novels, comics, watching detective shows (think Sherlock Holmes). I'm a foodie and I love to eat exotic food. I enjoy learning about new advancements in science and technology. Reach out if you want to talk technology, games, food or just geek out in general.
